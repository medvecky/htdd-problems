;  PROBLEM 1:
;  
;  In the lecture videos we designed a function to make a Sierpinski triangle fractal. 
;  
;  Here is another geometric fractal that is made of circles rather than triangles:
;  
;  .
;  
;  Design a function to create this circle fractal of size n and colour c.
;  


(define CUT-OFF 5)

;; Natural String -> Image
;; produce a circle fractal of size n and colour c

;  PROBLEM 2:
;  
;  Below you will find some data definitions for a tic-tac-toe solver. 
;  
;  In this problem we want you to design a function that produces all 
;  possible filled boards that are reachable from the current board. 
;  
;  In actual tic-tac-toe, O and X alternate playing. For this problem
;  you can disregard that. You can also assume that the players keep 
;  placing Xs and Os after someone has won. This means that boards that 
;  are completely filled with X, for example, are valid.
;  
;  Note: As we are looking for all possible boards, rather than a winning 
;  board, your function will look slightly different than the solve function 
;  you saw for Sudoku in the videos, or the one for tic-tac-toe in the 
;  lecture questions. 
;
