;  PROBLEM 2:
;  
;  Below you will find some data definitions for a tic-tac-toe solver. 
;  
;  In this problem we want you to design a function that produces all 
;  possible filled boards that are reachable from the current board. 
;  
;  In actual tic-tac-toe, O and X alternate playing. For this problem
;  you can disregard that. You can also assume that the players keep 
;  placing Xs and Os after someone has won. This means that boards that 
;  are completely filled with X, for example, are valid.
;  
;  Note: As we are looking for all possible boards, rather than a winning 
;  board, your function will look slightly different than the solve function 
;  you saw for Sudoku in the videos, or the one for tic-tac-toe in the 
;  lecture questions. 
;

;  PROBLEM 3:
;  
;  Now adapt your solution to filter out the boards that are impossible if 
;  X and O are alternating turns. You can continue to assume that they keep 
;  filling the board after someone has won though. 
;  
;  You can assume X plays first, so all valid boards will have 5 Xs and 4 Os.
;  
;  NOTE: make sure you keep a copy of your solution from problem 2 to answer 
;  the questions on edX.
